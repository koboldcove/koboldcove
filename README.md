## General Informations

KoboldCove is a fork of [Nyanotrasen](https://github.com/Nyanotrasen/Nyanotrasen). embracing a mixture of classic SS13 chaos and experimentation only possible with the new engine.

[Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14) is a remake of SS13 that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), a homegrown engine written in C#.

## Project goals and direction

This fork is focused exclusively on playing as Kobolds, a species of squished dwarf lizards, with no sexes and golem-like bodies.

We embraces the concept of ghosts being real and spirits needing host bodies upon death, instead of ignoring it like other forks or codebases.

The chems stations are removed, with drinks from the bartender providing healing effects of varying strengths.

The Cartographer role is replaced with a Scribe role, whose job is to document the round and upload it directly onto Discord as a continuous archive of the station's history.

The game promotes a sense of camaraderie and cooperation among players, with a focus on teamwork and an industrial feel, akin to Deep Rock Galactic, and players take on the roles of Kobolds taking over a rundown space station.
